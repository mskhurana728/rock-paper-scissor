//Algorithm   
// We have to make a function which randomly gives values in the form of rock, paper and scissor
// We have to make  a function named as computerPlay
//no arguments or parameters
//we will make a condition here using if and we will use math. random to make a random number between 1 to 3 if the 
//random number is 1 we will return rock if it is 2 we will return Paper and if it is 3 we will return Scissor i think it will work

function computerPlay(){
    let result;  //this variable will store the result value 
    let randomNo = (Math.floor(Math.random()*3) +1 ); // This will create a random number between 1 to 3including 1 and 3
    console.log(randomNo); //checking if it is working correctly
    console.log(typeof(randomNo)); //checking the type of random no
    if(randomNo===1){   //setting the conditions for results.
        result="Rock";
        console.log(result);
        return result;
    }else if(randomNo===2){
        result="Paper";
        console.log(result);
        return result;
    }else{
        result="Scissor";
        console.log(result);
        return result;
    }
}
// computerPlay(); // running to check if it works correctly


//Next Function
//Have to create a function named playRound which 
//will take two parameters playerSelection and computerSelection
//We have to return a string which will say that you loose or win using
//this syntax "You Lose! Paper beats Rock" and also we have to make our parameters case insensitive

//Algorithm
//Firstly we will declare the function with two parameters
//We will convert the string parameters to uppercase so that we can use it of equality in connditional statements
//if the playerSelection will be rock  and computer choice is scissor than the player wins like this we will make other cases
//we will use if statement to return the right result

function playRound(playerSelection,computerSelection){
    let winner;
    let playerChoice = playerSelection.toUpperCase(); //converting the string to uppercase to make it case insensitive
    let computerChoice= computerSelection.toUpperCase();
    console.log(playerChoice,computerChoice)
    if(playerChoice==="ROCK"&&computerChoice==="SCISSOR"){
        winner="You Win! Rock beats Scissor";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;

        
    }else if(playerChoice==="SCISSOR" && computerChoice==="PAPER"){
        winner="You Win! Scissor beats Paper";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;

    }else if(playerChoice==="PAPER" && computerChoice==="ROCK"){
        winner="You Win! Paper beats Rock";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;
    }else if(playerChoice==="ROCK" && computerChoice==="PAPER"){
        winner="You Loose! Paper beats Scissor";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;
    }else if(playerChoice==="SCISSOR" && computerChoice==="ROCK"){
        winner="You Loose! Rock beats Scissor";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;
    }else if(playerChoice==="PAPER" && computerChoice==="SCISSOR"){
        winner="You Loose! Scissor beats Paper";
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;
    }else{                                                              //its for when both the player choice and computer choice is same
        winner="Its a tie! Play Again!"
        console.log(winner);
        return winner;
    }
}
const playerSelection = prompt("Choose from Rock, Paper and Scissor. See console","Rock");
const computerSelection=computerPlay();
playRound(playerSelection,computerSelection);
